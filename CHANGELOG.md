### Known issues

* If multiple batteries have the same `unique_identifier`, then they are displayed as one battery in the VRM portal and if you change the name,
  it get changed for all dbus-serialbattries. Please change the capacity of the batteries to be unique (if the unique identifier ends with Ah)
  or change the custom field on supported BMS.
  E.g.: 278 Ah, 279 Ah,280 Ah,281 Ah and 282 Ah, if you have 5 batteries with 280 Ah.

### Breaking Changes

* Driver version greater or equal to `v1.1.20231223dev`

* Driver version greater or equal to `v1.0.20231128dev`

  * The custom name is not saved to the config file anymore, but to the dbus service com.victronenergy.settings. You have to re-enter it once.

  * If you selected a specific device in `Settings -> System setup -> Battery monitor` and/or `Settings -> DVCC -> Controlling BMS` you have to reselect it.

* Driver version greater or equal to `v1.0.20230629dev` and smaller or equal to `v1.0.20230926dev`:

  With `v1.0.20230927beta` the following values changed names:
